QUIZLY
Quizly is a quizzing website where you can solve a quiz in a fun and competitive way. This website has been created using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript, these languages were used as they are base, easy and efficient for designing a webpage and connecting it with firebase. HTML and CSS were used for webpage design while sJavaScript is used where logic is required.
 While creating this webpage we faced the problem of connecting the Realtime database with our model but we overcame the hurdle. We are planning to include more questions and multiple fields of questions for now we have included four fields of questions that are Operating system, Ethics, Database management System and Python. 
For running the website just download the file and save it all inside a folder, now replace the firebase key in some of the codes and start the website. Your website will be completely functional and ready to use.
We have provided the authorization page that is connected to the security in firebase and only a registered user can login-in a new user will first have to provide the details that are asked and only on verification will he be allowed access into the website, once you have sign in then you can login in anytime you want and after you have login in you will be asked to choose a field in which you want to give the quiz the topics for now are limited but we are working on increasing the topics and number of questions. You can start the quiz and solve the questions and after solving you will be shown your score with and shown how much did the players before you scored. This scoreboard is also connected to firebase and is updated in the database in Realtime.
